0. Fix Paho MQTT library?
1. Retrieve serial number from the inverter. Use it instead of the one from settings.
2. Dump stateful info into some state file (to speedup application startup and reduce the number of
   queries sent to inverter).
3. Add sensors for serial number, firmware versions, etc.
4. Add sensors for warnings.
5. Sensor: battery type.
6. Sensors: Battery re-charged and re-discharged voltage when utility is available.
7. Sensor: solar power priority.
8. Sensor: battery cut-off voltage.
9. Sensor: Set AC input voltage range ( Appliance, 1: UPS)
   The AC-Input terminal of the off-grid inverters accepts a wide range of sinusoidal voltages. The APL and UPS modes will allow a wider or narrower selection of voltages
   According to the application the user has to select between APL and UPS if the generator fails to connect to the inverter as a back up.
   APL 80-280
   UPS 170-280
   Named constants should include those values to be human understandable.
10. Switch: enable/disable machine supply power to the loads.
11. Switches for enable/disable various status flags.
12. Sensor: battery maximum charge current.
13. Sensor: battery maximum AC charge current.
14. (!) Sensor: AC output frequency. Is it really required? Dangerous setting.
15. Sensor: battery maximum charge voltage.
16. Sensor: "AC output rated voltage". What is it? Protocol isn't clear enough.
